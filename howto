This was built using contiki 2.6 but it was tested under 3.0 release

Replace udp-server.c and udp-client.c at /contiki/examples/ipv6/rpl-udp/ folder;

  New distributed version works by allowing every node to detect and mitigate (not only Sink)!!!
  
Create your simulation using tmote Sky, 1 server and many clients;
You can use script editor to automate attacks;
  The example called script_editor allows you to run a 10 hour simulation with 3 attackers starting with 20 seconds interval between them;
  You should save mote output to a file and use apend function to record all messages;
  These messages are useful to correlation and validate detection/mitigation of abnormal traffic generated by attacker node;

max of 20 nodes or you will experience memory issues!!!

Distributed version allows more nodes as the memory limitation is 20 nodes matrix... so as long as each node has less than 19 child nodes, you should be able to grow!!!

Enjoy!

P.S. > Parts of the codes may contain Portuguese language!!!
